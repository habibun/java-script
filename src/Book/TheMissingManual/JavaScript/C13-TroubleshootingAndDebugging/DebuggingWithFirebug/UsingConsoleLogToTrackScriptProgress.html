    /*For example, you could print the current value of the variable elementName to the
     console using this code:*/
    console.log(name);

    /*But if you wanted to precede the name with a message, you can write this:*/
    /*The special %s is
     way of saying “substitute the variable value with me.” In other words, %s gets
     replaced with the value of name*/
    console.log('User name: %s', name);

    /*You can add more than one variable to the message; just include one %s for each
     variable. For example, if you have two variables, name and score, and want to print
     both along with a custom log message, you can do the following:*/
    console.log('%s has a score of %s', name, score);

    /*You can use %s for numeric values, but Firebug provides two other tokens—%d
     and %f—to represent integers (like 1, 2, and 10) and floating point numbers (like
     1.22, and 2.4444). Using one of the two numeric tokens means the numbers are
     printed in a different color—just an easy way to tell them apart from the rest of the
     text.
     For example, you can rewrite the line of code above to display the number stored
     in the variable score:*/
    console.log('%s has a score of %d', name, score);

    /*but Firebug provides two other tokens—%d
     and %f—to represent integers (like 1, 2, and 10) and floating point numbers (like
     1.22, and 2.4444)*/
