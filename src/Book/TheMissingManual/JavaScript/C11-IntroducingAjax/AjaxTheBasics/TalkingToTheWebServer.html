<!--There are basically five steps, all of which can be accomplished with JavaScript.-->
<script>
    /* STEP 1: Create an instance of the XMLHttpRequest object. */

    <!--creating an XMLHttpRequest object in JavaScript looks like this:-->
    var newXHR = new XMLHttpRequest();


    /*STEP 2: Use the XHR’s open( ) method to specify what kind of data you’ll send and
     where the data will go.*/
    newXHR.open('GET', 'shop.php?productID=34');


    /*STEP 3: Create a function to handle the results.*/
    /*You also need to tell the XHR object about the callback function with code like
     the following:*/
    newXHR.onreadystatechange = myCallbackFunction;


    /*STEP 4: Send the request.*/
    /* If you’re using the GET method, this step is as simple as:*/
    newXHR.send(null);
    /*With the POST method,on the other hand, you must provide the data along with the send( ) method like this:*/
    newXHR.send('q=javascript');


    /*STEP 5: Receive the response*/
            /* ABOUT STATUS */
    /* status number 404 = it means the file wasn’t found */
    /* If everything went according to plan, you’ll get a status of 200 or possibly 304 */
    /* If there was an error processing the page, you’ll get a 500 “Internal Server Error” status report */
    /* if the file you requested is password protected, you’ll get a 403 “Access Forbidden” error */
