     * [-\w.]+ matches a hyphen, any word character, or a period one or more times. So it will match “bob,” “bob.smith,” or “bob-smith.”
     * @ is the @ sign you find in an email address: missing@sawmac.com.
     * • [A-z0-9] matches one letter or number
     * [-A-z0-9]+ matches one or more instances of a letter, number, or hyphen.
     * \. is a period character so it would match the period in sawmac.com.
     *  matches one or more instances of the pattern that includes the above three matches. This character allows for subdomain names like bob@mail.sawmac.com.
     *  [A-z]{2,4} is any letter 2, 3, or 4 times. This matches the com in .com, or uk in .uk
     *
