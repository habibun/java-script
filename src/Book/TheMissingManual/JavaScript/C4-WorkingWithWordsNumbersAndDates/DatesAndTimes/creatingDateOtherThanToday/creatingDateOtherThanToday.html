    //When using the Date( ) method, you can also specify a date and time in the future or past. The basic format is this:
    new Date(year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds, milliseconds);

    //For example, to create a Date for noon on New Yearâ€™s Day 2010, you could do this:
    var ny2010 = new Date(2010, 0, 1, 12, 0, 0, 0);

    //For example, to just create a date object for January 1, 2010, you could do this:
    //you can skip other option
    var ny2010 = new Date(2010, 0, 1);

    //    Note: Remember that JavaScript uses 0 for January, 1 for February, and so on
