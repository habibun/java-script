//    \d = which matches any single number
//    a single period (.) represents a single character, any character
//    while \w matches any letter or number (but not spaces, or symbols like $ or %)
//    Since \d matches a single number, a simple way to match five numbers is with this regular expression: \d\d\d\d\d
