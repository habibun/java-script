In addition, the following words, which are legal in ordinary JavaScript code, are re- served in strict mode:
implements
let
private
public
yield interface
package
protected
static

Strict mode also imposes restrictions on the use of the following identifiers. They are not fully reserved, but they are not allowed as variable, function, or parameter names:
arguments
eval


ECMAScript 3 reserved all the keywords of the Java language, and although this has been relaxed in ECMAScript 5, you should still avoid all of these identifiers if you plan to run your code under an ECMAScript 3 implementation of JavaScript:
abstract
double
goto
native
static
boolean
enum
implements
package
super byte
export
import
private
synchronized
char
extends
int
protected
throws
class
final
interface
public
transient
const
float
long
short
volatile


JavaScript predefines a number of global variables and functions, and you should avoid using their names for your own variables and functions:
arguments
encodeURI
Infinity
Number
RegExp
Array
encodeURIComponent
isFinite
Object
String
Boolean
Error
isNaN
parseFloat
SyntaxError
Date
eval
JSON
parseInt
TypeError
decodeURI
EvalError
Math
RangeError
undefined
decodeURIComponent
Function
NaN
ReferenceError
URIError
