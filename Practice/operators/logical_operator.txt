logical operator:


operator            description                                                                                             example
&&                  called logical AND operator.If both the operands are non zero then condition becomes true.              (A && B) is true.
||                  Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands are non zero then then condition becomes true    (A || B) is true.
!                   Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true   !(A && B) is false.
                    then Logical NOT operator will make false



Given that x=6 and y=3, the table below explains the logical operators:
Operator                            Description                                 Example
&&                                  and                                         (x < 10 && y > 1) is true
||                                  or                                          (x==5 || y==5) is false
!                                   not                                         !(x==y) is true
